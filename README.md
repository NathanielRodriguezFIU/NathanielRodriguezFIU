## HI! 👋

I'm Nathaniel, but just call me Nate!

I'm a Computer Science major, studying in FIU. I like working on creative projects, especially when it comes to Game Development.

I know how to use a large variety of tools. Unity 6.0+, Unreal 5.0+, and Godot 4+. I've tinkered around in all three, working on various small projects. Most privately though, since they're either incomplete, or I have plans for them in the future. 

I'm also always trying to better my artistic ability, whether its 3D modeling or 2D drawing. I use Blender and Procreate respectively. Another tool I'm always using is Obsidian as well!

And coding wise, I'm well versed in Python, C++, C#, and GDScript!

**Hobbies**: Gaming, Anime, Cooking, and going to the Gym!
• Some of my favorite *games* are: Subnautica, Hollow Knight, Animal Crossing, Minecraft, and Lisa: The Painful.
• Some of my favorite *anime* are: March Comes in Like a Lion, Deathnote, Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, and Ascendence of a Bookworm.
